# Python Old Practice

Old code written for the purpose of practice in Python.

Specifically, there are 9 files, none of which are really related to each other,
written in Python that covers a good understanding of how to code in Python.


Overview of the 9 files.

# AgeInSecondsDiff.py
  Gives the age difference between two people in seconds after birthdate input.
  
# DetermineKeySig.py
  Determines the key signature of a music piece based off whether it is major/minor
  and off the number of nonaccidental sharps or flats.
  
# EmailAtIndexSearch.py
  Returns the index of the @ symbol in an inputted email address.
  
# FibonacciNumRecurs.py
  A practice in coding recursive functions. Two functions specifically. One computes
  the n-th Fibonacci number and the other computes the number of function calls to
  the n-th Fibonacci number.

# HexdecColorConversion.py
  Converts a hexadecimal color code to its corresponding base 10 red, green, and
  blue values.
  
# LetterCountInNames.py
  Asks user to input names and counts the number of occurences of a given letter
  within the names.
  
# PalindromeCheck.py
  Checks if a word is a palindrome. Is it the same word reversed?
  
# ReduceWhitespace.py
  Gets rid of extra white space in a user-inputted sentence.

# RPNEvaluation.py
  Evaluates an RPN mathematical expression inputted by the user. For the purpose of
  practice with the stack data structure.

# censor.py
  Censors a given word with * in a given string text.

# count.py
  Counts occurrences of an element (item) in a given list (sequence)

# median.py
  Returns median from a given list (numbers)

# remove_duplicates.py
  Removes duplicate elements within a given list of numbers
